            <h1>Teriyaki Salmon</h1>
                <img src="../img/salmon.jpg"/>
            <p>
                Teriyaki salmon is my husband's favorite dish. 
                This recipe never fails to be a hit, whether we 
                broil the salmon in the oven or grill it outdoors. 
                Pair it with some homemade teriyaki fried rice to 
                complete your meal.

            <ul>
                <li>¼ cup sesame oil</li>
                <li>¼ cup lemon juice</li>
                <li>¼ cup soy sauce</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons brown sugar, or more to taste</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon sesame seeds</li> 
                <li>1 teaspoon ground mustard</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon ground ginger</li>  
                <li>¼ teaspoon garlic powder</li>   
                <li>4 (6 ounce) salmon steaks</li>   
            </ul>

            <ol>
                <h4>Step 1</h4>
                <li>
                    Mix sesame oil, lemon juice, soy sauce, brown sugar, 
                    sesame seeds, ground mustard, ginger, and garlic powder 
                    in a small saucepan over low heat. Bring to a simmer, 
                    stirring until sugar has dissolved. Set aside 1/2 cup 
                    of marinade for basting.
                </li>
                <h4>Step 2</h4>
                <li>
                    Pour remaining marinade into a resealable plastic bag. 
                    Add salmon steaks, coat with marinade, squeeze out excess 
                    air, and seal the bag. Marinate in the refrigerator for 1 
                    to 2 hours.
                </li>
                <h4>Step 3</h4>
                <li>
                    Set an oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and 
                    preheat the oven's broiler.
                </li>
                <h4>Step 4</h4>
                <li>
                    Broil salmon steaks under the preheated broiler for 5 
                    minutes, brushing salmon with reserved marinade. Turn and 
                    continue to broil until salmon is opaque and flakes easily, 
                    about 5 more minutes. Brush with marinade.
