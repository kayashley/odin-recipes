                If these lemon ricotta pancakes were any lighter, they would 
                float off the plate! They are easy to make and delicious 
                served with a pat of butter, lemon zest, and a drizzle of 
                maple syrup.

            <ul>
                <li>¾ cup cold water or milk</li>
                <li>½ teaspoon baking soda</li>
                <li>½ cup ricotta cheese</li>
                <li>1 large egg</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon grated lemon zest (just the yellow part of the skin)</li> 
                <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon white sugar</li>  
                <li>⅛ teaspoon vanilla extract</li>   
                <li>1 cup self-rising flour</li>   
                <li>2 tablespoons self-rising flour</li>   
                <li>2 tablespoons melted butter</li>   
                <li>1 tablespoon lemon juice</li>
            </ul>

            <ol>
                <h4>Step 1</h4>
                <li>
                    Whisk cold water and baking soda in a mixing bowl. 
                    Add ricotta cheese, egg, lemon zest, vegetable oil, 
                    sugar, and vanilla; whisk until smooth, breaking up 
                    lumps of cheese as you mix.
                </li>
                <h4>Step 2</h4>
                <li>
                    Whisk in 1 cup plus 2 tablespoons self-rising flour, 
                    melted butter, and lemon juice until most of flour 
                    disappears into batter. Let batter sit at room 
                    temperature for 15 minutes.
                </li>
                <h4>Step 3</h4>
                <li>
                    Heat a lightly oiled griddle over medium-high heat.
                </li>
                <h4>Step 4</h4>
                <li>
                    Drop batter by large spoonfuls onto the hot griddle 
                    and cook until bubbles form and the edges are dry, 2 
                    to 3 minutes. Flip and cook until browned on the other 
                    side, 2 to 3 minutes. Repeat with remaining batter.
                </li>
